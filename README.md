#Project Description
The Password Generator website creates secure, random, and customizable passwords for users, ensuring strong online account security and convenience in managing credentials.


#The Problem Statement
People are terrible at creating strong passwords. They either use overly simple passwords or repeat the same one everywhere, making their accounts vulnerable to hacking.



#The Solution
We’re bringing fun and function together by automating the password creation process with a secure generator. It’s easy to use, customizable, and makes sure your password isn’t “password123” ever again!
